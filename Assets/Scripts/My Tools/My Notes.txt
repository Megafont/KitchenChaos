NOTE: I added assembly references in the MyTools subfolders. The editor scripts were causing my build
	  of Kitchen Chaos to fail. I ended up finding the solution to put the editor scripts in
	  an editor only assembly. I also found out that if there are editor scripts in some other
	  folder in the project, you can add an Assemby Reference asset in that folder, which I
	  believe adds them to the referenced assembly.


Package.json is a sample json file for a Unity package.

You can use it to install the corresponding package by choosing
"Import package from disk" from the Package Manager's + menu in the top left.

Git-amend's YouTube video shows this as a way to quickly import your own
tools or code from somewwhere on Github into your project.
This can also be done via a method similar to Setup.InstallOpenSource() in
the /My Tools/Editor folder, which adds a command in the Tools/Setup menu
in Unity.

He covers this at the end of this video:

NOTE: If the json file is somewhere inside your asset folder, it will cause an error
	  when you do this, but he shows it still getting imported ok, though recommends to
	  place this and your common tools code such as this \My tools\ folder somwhere outside
	  your project folder. Then the tools code has to be imported too, of course.
